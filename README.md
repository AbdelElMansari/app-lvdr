## React Native + Wordpress Rest API

A simple and reusable React Native (@expo) project that connects with a Wordpress Rest API and authenticates using JWT protocol. The folder structure is based on some research about good practices mixed with personal preferences.

## JWT Authentication

I built a simple login form that asks the api for a JWT token and then save it in the device local storage.
